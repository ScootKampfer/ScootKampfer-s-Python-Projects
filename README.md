# GabN-Kamper-Python-Journey

I'm trying to learn Python by practicing on multiple projects. 

I did a World Capitals game, a Mad Libs game and I'm exploring other projects to do.

If you have any ideas, please send them to me on Discord (Scoot_Kampfer#2304)!

Currently testing out projects from https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners/.
